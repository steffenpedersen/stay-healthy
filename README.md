# Stay Healthy üçé

This is a personal guide for staying healthy. It is by no means an official guide, and I am by no means an instructor or trained to teach in this field. I am just a web developer who has got a tiny belly üê∑

I will in this simple personal guide show a training program, calorie intake, meal plan and eating supplements.

## Training Program

Here is my training program with exercises, that I am currently doing. I am myself somewhat of a beginner. It is therefore a good idea to focus on the basics, and to perform the exercises properly. This will by far provide the best foundation in the long term.

| Monday                 | Wednesday           | Friday                 |
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Olympic squat          | Front squat         | Olympic squat          |
| Rumanian deadlift      | Deadlift            | Rumanian deadlift      |
| Bench press            | Incline bench press | Incline dumbbell press |
| Bent over barbell rows | Pendlay rows        | Dumbbell rows          |
| Arnold press           | Push press          | Military press         |
| Pullups                | Pulldowns           | Chinups                |
| Cardio                 | Cardio              | Cardio                 |

I usually go 5 x 5 on each exercise and 30 minutes of cardio.

## Calorie Intake

What you eat is crucial, if you want a healthy lifestyle. It is important to know your calorie intake, and the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight. From there you navigate whether you want to build muscle or lose fat. I want to lose fat and not to lose musles üí™üèªüê∑. It is also important to know the balance of protein, carbohydrate and fat. 

My personally maintaining calorie intake is 2580 calories a day. Here I will subtract 500 calories, so it will be around **2080 calories a day**. People have different numbers based on age, weight and activity levels. Don‚Äôt forget to use a [TDEE calculator][tdee].

I will use a split of **40%** carbohydrates, **40%** proteins and **20%** fats. I will eat lower carb, because my body reacts quite quickly to it. It is important to point out that all numbers are indicative.
