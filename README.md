# Stay Healthy üçé

This is a personal guide for staying healthy. It is by no means an official guide, and I am by no means an instructor or trained to teach in this field. I am just a web developer who has got a tiny belly üê∑

I will in this simple personal guide show a training program, calorie intake, meal plan and eating supplements.

## Training Program

Here is my training program with exercises, that I am currently doing. I am myself somewhat of a beginner. It is therefore a good idea to focus on the basics, and to perform the exercises properly. This will by far provide the best foundation in the long term.

| Monday                 | Wednesday           | Friday                 |
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Olympic squat          | Front squat         | Olympic squat          |
| Rumanian deadlift      | Deadlift            | Rumanian deadlift      |
| Bench press            | Incline bench press | Incline dumbbell press |
| Bent over barbell rows | Pendlay rows        | Dumbbell rows          |
| Arnold press           | Push press          | Military press         |
| Pullups                | Pulldowns           | Chinups                |
| Cardio                 | Cardio              | Cardio                 |

I usually go 5 x 5 on each exercise and 30 minutes of cardio.
