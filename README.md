# Stay Healthy 🍎

This is a personal guide for staying healthy. It is by no means an official guide, and I am by no means an instructor or trained to teach in this field. I am just a web developer who has got a tiny belly 🐷

I will in this simple personal guide show a training program, calorie intake, meal plan and eating supplements.

## Training Program

Here is my training program with exercises, that I am currently doing. I am myself somewhat of a beginner. It is therefore a good idea to focus on the basics, and to perform the exercises properly. This will by far provide the best foundation in the long term.
